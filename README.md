# Internship Task 6 — Password Strength Evaluation

##  Objective
The goal of this task is to understand how password strength is measured, create sample passwords, test them using online tools, and analyze the results. This helps in learning why some passwords are weak, while others are strong, and how attackers try to crack them.

##  Contents
- `REPORT.md` — Full report with results, analysis, and best practices.  
- `screenshots/` — Screenshots of password test results (with passwords redacted).  

---

##  Methodology
1. Created 5 sample passwords with varying complexity.  
2. Tested them using password strength tools (e.g., passwordmeter.com).  
3. Recorded the accuracy/strength percentage for each.  
4. Analyzed why some passwords scored higher or lower.  
5. Researched common password attacks and summarized best practices.

##  Results (Summary)
- Strong passwords scored up to **100%** accuracy.  
- Weak passwords scored as low as **37%**.  
- Medium-strength passwords scored around **70–75%**.  
- Factors affecting strength: **length, randomness, character variety**.  

---

##  Best Practices
- Use **long (12+ characters)** and complex passwords.  
- Avoid dictionary words and personal information.  
- Use **different passwords** for each account.  
- Prefer a **password manager** to store and generate strong passwords.  
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for extra security.  

---

##  Notes
- All passwords used in this project were **test samples only**, not real passwords.  
- Screenshots have been **redacted** to avoid exposing actual password strings.
